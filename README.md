# 👋 Hey, I'm Sandy Lauguico — Just Another Nerd on the Internet

I'm an Electronics Engineer who accidentally wandered into Data & AI <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7006252743405305856-fCnt?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABwHM-MBtcv4Wx2rOT7AlHx8hBUiK_lyKro" target="_blank">full gossip 🍿 here</a>, and now I pretend to know what I'm doing (spoiler: sometimes it works!). I build things that hopefully don’t crash, and occasionally write about them like I knew what I was doing all along.


## 💰 What I Do to Pay the Bills (and Feed My WiFi Addiction)

- Freelance Data & AI Scientist/Engineer  
- Translating human and business problems into Python bugs (🐍🪲)

## 🚀 What I'm Currently Up To (Besides Forgetting to Take Breaks)

- Building practical, sometimes over-engineered Data & AI projects  
- Writing Medium posts that start with “In today’s fast-paced digital world…”  
- Trying to demystify data careers without turning into another LinkedIn influencer... 🤫 Sshhh I am a trying-hard *knowledgefluencer™*

## 💡 Current Focus (Whenever I Can)

I'm knee-deep in Full Stack Software Engineering (with a main quest in Data & AI wizardry), working on projects that combine data pipelines, APIs, machine learning, LLMs, AI Agents, (including all those Ops and anything trendy) and that one bug I swore I fixed yesterday.

## 📝 Content Creation (A.K.A. Talking to Myself on the Internet)

You can find my technical rants, tutorials, and semi-useful insights on:

- 🐙 GitHub (you’re already here — congrats!)  
- ✍️ [Medium](https://medium.com/me/stories/public) — where I write articles instead of journaling and therapy  
- 📱 Social media (where I try to be relevant)  
- 🇵🇭 Local tech communities (because shouting into the void is more fun with friends)
- 📺 You can also type in **Sandy Lauguico** on YouTube and see me talk about data and careers (like I already have it all figured out 😂)

## 📍 Roadmaps for the Confused (Like Me)

These are Notion roadmaps I made after several existential crises and too much caffeine:

- 🗺️ [Data Analyst Roadmap](https://shadow-blue-572.notion.site/c3f88e41209349f6a0a18c40684a420a)  
  *(For when Excel isn't enough and SQL becomes your love language)*

- 🛠️ [Data Engineer Roadmap](https://shadow-blue-572.notion.site/b880b4ef0b1445aabec127442b97c79f?v=0a45fb3e2b5946d59708797eeea16671)  
  *(For those who enjoy pipelines, logs, automation, and debugging things they definitely didn’t touch)*

## 🤝 Let’s Connect (Or Just Lurk — That’s Cool Too)

- 💼 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandy-lauguico-257592111/) - Come for the resume, stay for "I am trying to be a 'professional' there"
- 🌐 [sailauguico.io](https://sailauguico.io) - My corner of the internet, now 12% prettier (or geekier?) and proudly overpriced, when I could’ve just used a .xyz, courtesy of GoDaddy 💸

> ☕ Fun fact:  
> 1 coffee = 1 bug fix  
> 3 coffees = a blog post  
> 5 coffees = I’ll finally read the docs
